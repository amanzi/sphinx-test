Steady-State One-Dimensional Flow: Materials in Serial
------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For one-dimensional, steady-state, flow through a saturated porous medium with constant properties, 
the general governing differential equation expressing mass conservation and Darcy's law becomes simply

	.. math:: \frac{d^2h}{dx^2} = 0
		:label: ode

where the total head (:math:`h`, [L]) is the sum of pressure head (:math:`P/\rho g`, [L]) 
and elevation (:math:`z`, [L])

	.. math:: h = \frac{P}{\rho g}+z

:math:`\rho` = density [M/L\ :sup:`3`\ ], :math:`g` = gravitational acceleration [L/T\ :sup:`2`\ ], 
and :math:`x` = horizontal distance [L]. The ordinary differential equation :eq:`ode` is easily solved by 
direct integration as

	.. math:: h = C_1 x + C_2
		:label: generalSoln

where the integration constants :math:`C_1` and :math:`C_2` depend on the boundary conditions.

For a simple heterogeneous porous medium composed of two constant-property materials in series, 
Equation :eq:`generalSoln` can be applied to each subregion separately
with the interface conditions treated as boundary conditions for the two subregions. To analyze this 
special case, let the subscripts *1* and *2* denote the subregions adjoining the :math:`x = 0` and :math:`x = L` 
boundaries respectively, and the subscript *i* denote the interface.


Analytic solution for prescribed inlet and outlet pressures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When hydraulic head is prescribed at both boundaries as

	.. math:: 
		h(0) &= h_0\\
		h(L) &= h_L
		:label: BCs

the analytic solutions :eq:`generalSoln` for hydraulic head in each subregion become

	.. math:: 
		h_1 &= (h_i - h_0) \frac{x}{L_i} + h_0\\
		h_2 &= (h_L - h_i) \frac{x-L_i}{L-L_i} + h_i
		:label: specificSolns

where :math:`L` = domain length [L], :math:`L_i` = position of interface [L], and :math:`h_i` 
is yet to be defined. 
The volumetric flowrate per unit area through a porous medium, or Darcy velocity (:math:`U`, [L/T]), 
is defined by Darcy's law as

	.. math:: U = -\frac{k}{\mu\rho g}\frac{dh}{dx} = -K\frac{dh}{dx}
		:label: DarcyVel

where :math:`k` = intrinsic permeability [L\ :sup:`2`\ ],
:math:`\mu` = viscosity [M/LT], and 
:math:`K` = hydraulic conductivity [L/T]. 
Applying Equation :eq:`DarcyVel` to each subregion using Equations :eq:`specificSolns` yields

	.. math:: 
		U_1 &= K_1\frac{h_0 - h_i}{L_i}\\
		U_2 &= K_2\frac{h_i - h_L}{L-L_i}\\
		:label: specificDarcyVels

Mass conservation at the interface implies :math:`U_1 = U_2`, which after some algebra leads to
an expression for hydraulic head at the interface:

	.. math:: h_i = \frac{K_1(L-L_i)h_0+K_2L_ih_L}{K_1(L-L_i)+K_2L_i}
		:label: interfaceHead

Equations :eq:`specificSolns` and :eq:`interfaceHead` collectively define hydraulic head across the
domain, and Equation :eq:`specificDarcyVels` or :eq:`interfaceHead` the Darcy velocity. One can also
show that

	.. math:: 
		U = K_h\frac{h_0 - h_L}{L}
		:label: domainDarcyVel

where :math:`K_h` is the harmonic mean

	.. math:: 
		K_h = \frac{K_1K_2L}{K_1(L-L_i) + K_2L_i}
		:label: harmonicMean


Amanzi verification test problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The analytic solutions for hydraulic head and Darcy velocity can be used to test Amanzi
implementation of prescribed hydraulic head boundary conditions, Darcy's law, and mass conservation
on an elementary problem with discrete heterogeneity. 
To generate numerical results the following specifications are considered:

* Domain

	* :math:`x_{min} = y_{min} = z_{min} = 0`
	* :math:`x_{max} = 100 m, y_{max} = 2 m, z_{max} = 10 m`

* Horizontal flow in the x-coordinate direction

	* no-flow prescribed at the :math:`y_{min}, y_{max}, z_{min}, z_{max}` boundaries
	* prescribed hydraulic head at the x-coordinate boundaries: :math:`h(0) = 20m, h(L) = 19m`

* Material properties:

	* :math:`\rho = 998.2 \: kg/m^3, \mu = 1.002e-3 \: Pa\cdot s, g = 9.807 \: m/s^2` 
	* :math:`L_i = x_{max}/2`
	* :math:`K_1 = 1.0 m/d` :math:`(k = 1.1847E-12 m^2)`
	* :math:`K_2 = 10 m/d` :math:`(k = 1.1847E-11 m^2)`

* Model discretization

	* :math:`\Delta x = 5 m, \Delta y = 2 m, \Delta z = 10 m`

For these input specifications, Amanzi simulation output is expected to closely match

	.. math:: h_i = 19.090909m
		:label: expectedH_i

and exhibit a linear head profile within each subregion following Equations :eq:`specificSolns`.
The harmonic mean is :math:`1.818181818	m/d` from Equation :eq:`harmonicMean` and thus the 
expected Darcy velocity is 

	.. math:: U = 0.0181818 m/d 
		:label: expectedU

from Equation :eq:`domainDarcyVel`.
