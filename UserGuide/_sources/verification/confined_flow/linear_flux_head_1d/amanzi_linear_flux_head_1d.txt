Steady-State One-Dimensional Flow with Flux and Head Boundary Conditions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For one-dimensional, steady-state, flow through a saturated porous medium with constant properties, 
the general governing differential equation expressing mass conservation and Darcy's law becomes simply

	.. math:: \frac{d^2h}{dx^2} = 0
		:label: ode

where the total head (:math:`h`, [L]) is the sum of pressure head (:math:`P/\rho g`, [L]) 
and elevation (:math:`z`, [L])

	.. math:: h = \frac{P}{\rho g}+z

:math:`\rho` = density [M/L\ :sup:`3`\ ], :math:`g` = gravitational acceleration [L/T\ :sup:`2`\ ], 
and :math:`x` = horizontal distance [L]. The ordinary differential equation :eq:`ode` is easily solved by 
direct integration as

	.. math:: h = C_1 x + C_2
		:label: generalSoln

where the integration constants :math:`C_1` and :math:`C_2` depend on the boundary conditions.

Analytic solution for prescribed inlet flow and outlet pressure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Darcy velocity is prescribed at the inlet boundary :math:`x = 0` and 
hydraulic head at the outlet :math:`x = L` as

	.. math:: 
		U(0) &= U_0\\
		h(L) &= h_L
		:label: BCs

the analytic solution :eq:`generalSoln` for hydraulic head becomes

	.. math:: h = \frac{U_0L}{K} (1 - \frac{x}{L})  + h_L
		:label: specificSoln

where :math:`L` = domain length [L]. For these boundary conditions the volumetric flowrate per unit area, 
or Darcy velocity (:math:`U`, [L/T]), is constant and defined by Darcy's law as

	.. math:: U = -\frac{k}{\mu}\rho g \frac{dh}{dx} = -K\frac{dh}{dx} = -K\frac{-U_0}{K} = U_0
		:label: DarcyVel

where :math:`k` = intrinsic permeability [L\ :sup:`2`\ ],
:math:`\mu` = viscosity [M/LT], and 
:math:`K` = hydraulic conductivity [L/T]. 

Amanzi verification test problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The analytic solutions for hydraulic head and Darcy velocity can be used to test Amanzi
implementation of prescribed hydraulic head boundary conditions, Darcy's law, and mass conservation
on an elementary problem. To generate numerical results the following specifications are considered:

* Domain

	* :math:`x_{min} = y_{min} = z_{min} = 0`
	* :math:`x_{max} = 100 m, y_{max} = 2 m, z_{max} = 10 m`

* Horizontal flow in the x-coordinate direction

	* no-flow prescribed at the :math:`y_{min}, y_{max}, z_{min}, z_{max}` boundaries
	* prescribed Darcy velocity at the x-coordinate inlet: :math:`U(0) = 0.01 \text{[m/d]}`
	* prescribed hydraulic head at the x-coordinate outlet: :math:`h(L) = 19 \text{[m]}`

* Material properties:

	* :math:`\rho = 998.2 \: \text{[kg/m}^3\text{]}`,
          :math:`\mu = 1.002e-3 \: \text{[Pa}\cdot \text{s]}`, 
          :math:`g = 9.807 \: \text{[m/s}^2\text{]}` 
	* :math:`K = 1.0 \text{[m/d]}` :math:`(k = 1.1847E-12 \text{[m}^2\text{]})`

* Model discretization

	* :math:`\Delta x = 5 \text{[m]}, \Delta y = 2 \text{[m]}, \Delta z = 10 \text{[m]}`

For these input specifications, Amanzi simulation output is expected to closely match

	.. math:: h = 20 -\frac{x}{100m} \text{[m]}
		:label: expectedH

and

	.. math:: U = 1.0 \text{[m/d]}
		:label: expectedU

following Equations :eq:`specificSoln` and :eq:`DarcyVel`.
